 * A change that could not be applied to the intended target graph.

 * A change that is perfectly valid according to the KGCL model may still fail
 * to be applied to a knowledge graph, if the contents of the knowledge graph
 * does not match what the change expects. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code obsolete EX:0001} will fail if the graph does not contain a node
 * with ID {@code EX:0001};
 * <li>{@code rename EX:0001 from "old label" to "new label"} if the current
 * label of node {@code EX:0001} is not {@code old label}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This class is merely a container for a tuple associating a KGCL change that
 * could not be applied and a human-readable message explaining what the
 * mismatch was.
